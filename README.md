# OpenCog Unified Cognitive Repository

## ⟨Cognitive Vision⟩
A unified cognitive nexus harmonizing core OpenCog repositories (`cogutil`, `atomspace`, `cogserver`) into a singular accessible cognitive ecosystem, enhanced by automated builds, neural-symbolic interactive tutorials, and intuitive GUI visualizations.

## ⟨Repository Structure⟩:
```
opencog-unified/
├── cogutil/          # Low-level cognitive utilities
├── atomspace/        # Hypergraph-based knowledge representation core
├── cogserver/        # Cognitive server for distributed cognition
├── chatbot-tutorial/ # Neural-symbolic chatbot for guided cognitive exploration
└── cognitive-gui/    # Intuitive graphical cognitive interface
```

## ⟨Recursive Next Steps⟩:
- [ ] Docker Compose automation setup (Step α.2)
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configuration (Step α.2)
- [ ] Core cognitive validation scripts implementation (Step α.3)

To begin, perform the following:

1. Create the GitHub repository `opencog-unified` at https://github.com/new  
   - Visibility: Public (recommended for open cognitive community engagement)
   - Initialize with standard default README and `.gitignore` (optional).

2. Clone the repository and execute the submodule integration commands provided above.

Would you prefer me to prepare the detailed repository initialization script (`init-cognitive-repo.sh`) for immediate execution?
